    <!-- Sets the path to the directory where cache .data files are created.

         If the path is a Java System Property it is replaced by
         its value in the running VM.

         The following properties are translated:
         user.home - User's home directory
         user.dir - User's current working directory
         java.io.tmpdir - Default temp file path -->

    <!--Predefined Caches.  Add your cache configuration settings here.
       If you do not have a configuration for your cache a WARNING will be issued when the
       CacheManager starts

       The following attributes are required for defaultCache:

       name              - Sets the name of the cache. This is used to identify the cache. It must be unique.
       maxInMemory       - Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory.
       eternal           - Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal, timeouts are ignored and the element
                             is never expired.
       timeToIdleSeconds - Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires. Is only used if the element is not
                             eternal. Idle time is now - last accessed time. A value of 0 means that an Element can idle for infinity. The default value is 0.
       timeToLiveSeconds - Sets the time to live for an element before it expires. Is only used if the element is not
                             eternal. TTL is now - creation time  . A value of 0 means that and Element can live for infinity. The default value is 0.
       overflowToDisk    - Sets whether elements can overflow to disk when the in-memory cache
                             has reached the maxInMemory limit.
      memoryStoreEvictionPolicy â€“ policy would be enforced upon reaching the maxEntriesLocalHeap limit. Default policy is Least Recently Used (specified as LRU).
